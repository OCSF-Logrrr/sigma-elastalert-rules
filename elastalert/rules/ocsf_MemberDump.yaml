description: 'Detects MySQL queries that dump **all columns** from the **member** table (e.g., `SELECT * FROM member`) inside OCSF Datastore-Activity events (`class_uid: 6005`, `activity_id: 4`).   The rule uses only term / regex checks and a single AND condition so it can be auto-translated to ElastAlert without modification.'
